# DOM JavaScript Example

This file contains a JavaScript code snippet that demonstrates the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) to create a dynamic webpage.

## Navigation Bar

The code creates a navigation bar using JavaScript DOM manipulation techniques. It generates the following elements:

- `header`: Represents the header section of the webpage.
- `div`: Contains the logo and menu items.
- `ul`: Represents an unordered list for the menu items.
- `li`: Represents each individual menu item.
- `TextNode`: Contains the text content for the logo and menu items.

The generated elements are styled using CSS properties such as `background-color`, `padding`, `display`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `color`.

## Content

The code also creates a content section dynamically using JavaScript. It generates a series of product boxes displayed in a grid layout. Each product box includes a number and a product name. The content section is styled with CSS properties like `display`, `padding`, `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`, `gap`, `min-height`, `box-sizing`, `background-color`, `border`, `width`, `text-align`, `color`, and `border-radius`.

## Footer

The footer is another dynamically created element. It includes a copyright notice and is styled with CSS properties such as `background-color`, `font-size`, `text-align`, `padding`, and `color`.

To see the dynamic elements and their styles in action, include the `js.js` file in an HTML document and run it in a web browser.

## Usage

To use this code:

1. Create an HTML file and save it with a `.html` extension.
2. Copy and paste the code into the HTML file.
3. Save the JavaScript code in a separate `js.js` file.
4. Link the `js.js` file to the HTML file using the `<script>` tag.
5. Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the dynamically generated elements and their styles.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different styles and functionalities.
